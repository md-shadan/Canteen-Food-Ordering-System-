The purpose is to build the application for ordering food online by various college' student and collect it faster instead of standing in the queue in this busy schedule.
- This project is a web application that allows college students to order food from their college canteen. 
- The system provides an online menu from which students can select their preferred dishes and make payments online.
- The system also allows for customization of orders and tracks order history for each user.
- The system will only allow the canteen staff to update the availabe food for that day.
